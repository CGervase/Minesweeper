# Minesweeper

This is a text-based Minesweeper game written in Java. Rather than clicking on a cell, coordinates are entered as two integers separated 
by a space (e.g. 2 4) and the corresponding cell is uncovered. Unlike the traditional mathematical coordinate system, the vertical 
coordinate should be entered before the horizontal coordinate. The coordinates of the board are set up from left to right and top to 
bottom, such that (0,0) corresponds to the top left cell. A demo of this program can be found [here] (https://repl.it/Djbf/34).

## Example
Here is an example of the program in action:
